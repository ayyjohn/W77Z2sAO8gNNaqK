# Our team has just discovered that search engines are negatively scoring
# our web-pages that include a link to the domain shittylistings.com. For
# simplicity assume that we have 50,000 HTML files in a Unix directory tree
# under a folder called "/website" (e.g. /website/home.html,
# /website/san-diego/2505-via-clarita.html, etc). We have 24 hours to
# get a list of file paths to the editorial staff so they can
# edit the pages and remove the links. You need to make a list of the
# .html files that contain links to the domain. How would you
# solve the problem? Keep in mind our team is on a short deadline.
